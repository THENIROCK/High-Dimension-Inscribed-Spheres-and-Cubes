            What would appear to be a sphere inside of a cube in our two or three dimensions completely inverts to a cube inside of an incomparably large sphere in higher dimensions. In this essay, we examine the curious nature of an Inscribed Kissing (IK) Sphere to understand why these counter-intuitive phenomena occur in higher dimensions and add rigour and reason to Barry Cipra's IK-Sphere problem from the first volume of \textit{What's Happening in the Mathematical Sciences}. Throughout the essay, two methods of reasoning -- an algebraic versus a geometric approach -- will be used with varying degrees of certainty versus intuition gained in each. Finally, we answer the research question: \textbf{Why does the radius of an IK-Sphere tend to infinity as dimensionality increases and does it truly intersect with its bounding box in $n\geq 4$ dimensions?}.
