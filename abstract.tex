\begin{abstract}
    We examine the patterns, counts, and behavior of coefficients of
powers of polynomials in a finite field. We use two methods to produce
matrices that let us quickly calculate the total number of occurences
of any coefficient, and examine some properties of the matrices. We
form conjectures on the maximum eigenvalues of these matrices and
methods for reducing their size. Furthermore, we examine the blocks
of coefficients that appear in the powers of polynomials when reduced
modulo some prime, and derive recursive formulae for the number of
blocks of varying sizes can appear for certain polynomials and primes.
