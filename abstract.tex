            We examine the patterns, counts, and behavior of coefficients of
            powers of polynomials in a finite field. We use two methods to produce
            matrices that let us quickly calculate the total number of occurences
            of any coefficient, and examine some properties of the matrices. We
            form conjectures on the maximum eigenvalues of these matrices and
            methods for reducing their size. Furthermore, we examine the blocks
            of coefficients that appear in the powers of polynomials when reduced
            modulo some prime, and derive recursive formulae for the number of
            blocks of varying sizes can appear for certain polynomials and primes. To answer the question: To what extent is it true that an inscribed sphere will expand outside of its bounding box as dimensionality increases?
