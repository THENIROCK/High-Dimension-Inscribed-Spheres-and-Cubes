\noindent Algebraic reasoning aims to abstract the IK-Sphere problem and formally generalise it to the unfamiliar four and above dimensions.

\section{The Radius of the IK-Sphere as Dimension Tends to Infinity}
The radius $r$ of the IK-Sphere can be solved for algebraically and generalised by extending the Pythagorean Theorem.
\begin{lemma}[Extended Pythagorean Theorem for $n$-cube]
    For an $n$-cube in $n$-dimensions, with a set of lines of length $a_1, a_2, a_3, ... , a_n$, each perpendicular to all others and originating from the same vertex, the length of the diagonal $c$ of the $n$-cube is given by
    \begin{equation}\label{extendedpythag}
        c^2 = \sum_{i}^{n}a_i^2
    \end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

    Assuming the original two-dimensional Pythagorean Theorem is proven,
    
    \noindent 
    Base case $\left(n=3\right)$
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            c^2&=1^2+1^2+1^2\\
            c&=\sqrt{3}
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
    So, the lemma holds for $n=3$.
    
    \noindent Inductive hypothesis: Suppose the theorem holds for all values of $n$ up to some $k$, $k \geq 3$.
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            c^2=\sum_{i}^{k}a_i^2
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
    
    \noindent Inductive step: Let $n=k+1$. 
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
        \sum_{i}^{k+1}a^2_{i}
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
    Then our right side is
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
        \sum_{i}^{k}a_i^2+a_{i+1}^2=\sum_{i}^{k+1}a^2_{i}
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
    which is our left side. So, the theorem holds for $n=k+1$. 
    By the principle of mathematical induction, the theorem holds for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
\end{proof}
Let us use a diagram for a 2D IK-Sphere to generalise the IK-Sphere radius $r_n$ to $n$-dimensions. Using the Extended Pythagorean Theorem for an $n$-cube we can determine the length of a diagonal (see line $\overline{\rm AB}$ in Figure \ref{fig:2d diagonal}) of a quadrant of our 2-cube that includes a unit $n$-sphere radius and the radius of the IK-Sphere which we wish to obtain. 
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{images/diagonal 2d.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:2d diagonal}Unit 2-cube diagonal length determined using Extended Pythagorean Theorem}
\end{figure}

\noindent Hence, we can subtract the unit circle radius to obtain the radius of the two-dimensional IK-Sphere: $$r_2 = \sqrt{1^2+1^2}-1.$$  %Then, dividing by 2, we get the radius of an IK-Sphere in two-dimensions: $$r_2=\frac{\sqrt{1^2+1^2}-2}{2}.$$ 

Similarly, for a three-dimensional IK-Sphere, the length of the diagonal is the square root of the sum of three sides of of an octant of the $n$-cube at a vertex (see Figure \ref{fig:3d diagonal}). From there, the process is the same and we subtract the unit sphere. Thus, we have an inscribed sphere radius $r_3$ of: 

\begin{equation*}
    r_3=\sqrt{1^2+1^2+1^2}-1.
\end{equation*}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/3d diagonal.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:3d diagonal}Unit 3-cube diagonal length determined using Extended Pythagorean Theorem}
\end{figure}

\begin{corollary}[To the Extended Pythagorean Theorem for $n$-Cubes] The diagonal $c$ of a unit $n$-cube is given by
\begin{equation} \label{ncube diagonal}
    c = \sqrt{n}
\end{equation}
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    Substituting $a=1$ into the extended Pythagorean Theorem (see Equation \ref{extendedpythag}), we have
    \begin{align*}
        c^2 &= \sum_{i}^{n}1_i^2\\
        &=n\\
        \therefore c &= \sqrt{n}.
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}

If the diagonal of a unit $n$-cube is given by $\sqrt{n}$ (see Equation \ref{ncube diagonal}), the IK-Sphere radius can be generalised across all $n$-dimensions by subtracting the unit sphere radius as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{radius of ik sphere}
    r_n = \sqrt{n}-1
\end{equation}

We may now proceed to the final step of proving that the radius of an IK-Sphere increases without bound.

\begin{theorem}
As the dimension $n$ tends to infinity, the radius $r_n$ of the inscribed sphere also tends to infinity.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Take the limit as $n$ approaches infinity of the expression for $r_n$ in terms of $n$ (See Equation \ref{radius of ik sphere}) and apply the difference law:
\begin{align*}
    \lim_{n\to\infty} \sqrt{n}-1 &= \lim_{n\to\infty} \sqrt{n} - \lim_{n\to\infty} \sqrt{1}\\
    &=\infty - 1\\
    &=\infty
\end{align*}
%Here begins the 2D plot

        \begin{axis}[
            axis lines = left,

        ]

        {sqrt(x)-1};
        \addlegendentry{\(\sqrt{n}-1\)}
        %Here the blue parabola is defined
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}

\end{figure}
    

%Here ends the 2D plot
$\therefore$ the radius of an IK-Sphere diverges to infinity as dimension $n$ increases.
\end{proof}




\section{Verification of the IK-Sphere at Nine Dimensions}
However, this does not help our high dimensional intuition. As such, geometric reasoning is required.
