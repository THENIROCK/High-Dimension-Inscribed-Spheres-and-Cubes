A geometric reasoning can aid in developing a better intuition for higher dimensional phenomena. This chapter aims to reason for why the IK-Sphere radius diverges in terms of space consumption of the IK-Sphere and the unit $n$-spheres it `kisses'.

\begin{definition}[Volume]
    Here, volume has been generalised across $n$ dimensions as the number of unit $n$-cubes of space a shape occupies. For example, `area' is volume in two-dimensional space, as is `volume' in three-dimensional space. 
\end{definition}
